# LIRI-node-app
 - Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface
 
 LIRI is a node application which when run in the terminal will supply the user with various type of information.
 
 The user will present the key-words to liri :
 
    * `my-tweets`

    * `spotify-this-song`

    * `movie-this`

    * `do-what-it-says`

My Tweets will return the last few tweets from my Twitter account.
Spotify this song will accept a track which will then be searched for in spotify's database and return the track's Artist, Album and a link to a preview of the song.
Movie this will accept a movie name and then provide the year the movie came out, ratings from IMBD and Rotten Tomatoes, country of production, language(s), actors, and the plot. All information provided from OMDB Api.
The do what it says command will take information from a .txt file and spotify a specific song!
